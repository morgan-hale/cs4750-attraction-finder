Make sure you have the UVA VPN running if you're trying to connect to the database off-Grounds.

The URL of the locally-hosted server is http://localhost/[file path to file]/[file name]
Like for Morgan's it's http://localhost/attraction-finder/cs4750-attraction-finder/request.php (yes i did indeed add another folder on accident shh)

We can use MD5 has to hash passwords (the inserted data is doing this so if we decide to change, don't forget to change it in the database). See this website to generate them: https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/
